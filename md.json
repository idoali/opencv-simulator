{"Threshold": "### Threshold\nThe function cv.threshold is used to apply the thresholding. The first argument is the source image, which should be a grayscale image. The second argument is the threshold value which is used to classify the pixel values. The third argument is the maximum value which is assigned to pixel values exceeding the threshold. All simple thresholding types are: \n- cv2.THRESH_BINARY\n- cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV\n- cv2.THRESH_TRUNC\n- cv2.THRESH_TOZERO\n- cv2.THRESH_TOZERO_INV\n\n[Open CV Documentation on Threshold](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html)", "Low Pass Filter": "### Low Pass Filter\nAs in one-dimensional signals, images also can be filtered with various low-pass filters (LPF). A Kernel will walk through the picture to filter and make a new picture.\n\n$$Kernel = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\end{bmatrix} \\cdot K$$\n\n[Open CV Documentation on Low Pass Filter](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/d13/tutorial_py_filtering.html)", "Canny Threshold": "### Canny Edge Detection\nCanny Edge Detection is a popular edge detection algorithm that use Noise Reduction, Finding Intensity Gradient of the Image, Non-maximum Suppression,  and Hysteresis Thresholding\n\n[Open CV Documentation on Canny Edge Detection](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/da/d22/tutorial_py_canny.html)", "Gamma Correction": "### Gamma Correction\nGamma correction is the feature in image processing where we increase the brightness of the input\n\n$$Output = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1{}_1 & x_1{}_2 & x_1{}_3 & ... & x_1{}_x\\\\ x_2{}_1 & x_2{}_2 & x_2{}_3 & ... & x_2{}_x\\\\ x_3{}_1 & x_3{}_2 & x_3{}_3 & ... & x_3{}_x\\\\ ... & ... & ... & ... & ...\\\\ x_y{}_1 & x_y{}_2 & x_y{}_3 & ... & x_y{}_x\\end{bmatrix} ^ {\\gamma}$$\nThat is how it works"}
