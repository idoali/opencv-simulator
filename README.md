# OpenCV Simulator

This is a Open CV Simulator created for education. There are people that are still confused with the function in Open CV and this simulator can help them to understand those functions. 

## Full Version

You can use the full version by pulling the whole repository and run them in your local desktop. 

```
git clone https://github.com/idoali/opencv-simulator.git
```

Make sure that you run **app_with_webcam.py** instead of **app.py**. There is still some problem on streamlit applications that uses webcam deployed in **Streamlit Share** so the only way to use the webcam version is through your local computer.

```
streamlit run app_with_webcam.py
```

If you want to see the app that has been deployed, you can visit the link below.
